A simple netlogo model simulating a population that goes from monogamy to polyamory

This is a very simple agent-based model simulating simulating a population that goes from monogamy to polyamory. It is written in NetLogo. In the tradition of NetLogo models, the documentation is added to the Info tab of the model itself. 

To run it:
* Download and install NetLogo: https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo
* Download the `.nlogo` file(s) from the `Code` folder
* Launch the NetLogo application and,  from inside it, open the `.nlogo` file you want to run.
